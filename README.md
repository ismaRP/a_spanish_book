Code for the MS data analysis for the paper "A biological reading of a palimpsest".

The code is divided in two notebooks:
- Spectra preprocessing. From sample replicate spectra to a matrix of samples by peaks. We normalize intensity, 
- Data analysis. Batch correction with surrogate variable analysis, PCA, clustering, binary discriminant analysis and theoretical collagen markers alignment using bacollite
